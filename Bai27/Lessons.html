      Here at The Colorado Experience we provide several levels of climbing
      instruction, all tailored to your individual strengths, interests and
      comfort levels. You can start your lessons on small one and two pitch
      climbs and move up to larger routes. We cover everything from working with
      hand and footholds to working with ice axes. Lessons are always under the
      watchful and encouraging eye of an experienced instructor. Special
      instruction is also available for those with special physical needs or
      requirements.
