    One of the most awesome climbs in the park, yet still very accessible to the
    beginning climber, Kiener's Route is a Colorado Experience favorite. The
    route starts at Mills Glacier and proceeds up a 1000 foot couloir known as
    Lamb's Slide (ice axes and crampons required to climb Lamb's Slide.) Moving
    off Lamb's Slide, you are led across Broadway, a narrow ledge varying in
    width from several feet to six inches. The ledge overlooks a sheet of
    granite plunging down to Chasm Lake far below. Proceeding up from Broadway,
    you will climb to the summit of Longs Peak following a route requiring
    climbing gear and climbing technique. Kiener's is one of North America's
    classic climbs.
