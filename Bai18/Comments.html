      "Mary is a highly professional technician who takes much pride in her
      work. She impressed me with her attention to details of our sophisticated
      and complex hardware and software, especially given her lack of
      telecommunications experience when she first started with us. Mary worked
      as a vital team member and was able to take my suggestions and finish a
      project in a highly competent manner and in a far shorter time than
      expected. As those on her work force, I find her to be a consistent and
      essential worker in our operations. Her complete confidence that you will
      be very pleased with Mary’s work and work ethic is very high."

      "Mary assisted in the operation and development of a new database program
      we were setting up. I found Mary to be an enthusiastic and hard-working
      addition to our staff. Mary is one of those people who brings her best
      effort every day she is on the job as well as whenever she does tasks away
      from the job site."

      time she never ceased to amaze me with her quick ability to learn our
      systems and her willingness to help customers and fellow employees alike."
