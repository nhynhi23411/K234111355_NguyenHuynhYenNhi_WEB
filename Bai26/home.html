          <p>
            Welcome to the Dunston Retreat Center. Whether you are planning to
            attend one of our many conferences or embarking on a private
            retreat, we're sure that you will enjoy your stay.
          </p>

          <p>
            Located in the northern woods of Wisconsin, the Dunston Retreat
            Center provides comfortable and attractive accommodations while you
            enjoy the rustic setting available just outside your door. The
            Retreat Center has 32 beds, large meeting rooms, a chapel, and
            kitchen facilities. If you want to get out, there are ample
            opportunities for hiking, canoeing and horseback riding in the
            surrounding area.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout the year the center staff conducts retreats to
            accommodate the needs of various groups. We offer retreats for men,
            for women, and for couples. Please call about special needs
            retreats.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you prefer, an individually directed retreat is possible. The
            retreat includes a time of daily sharing and guidance by a retreat
            director to supplement your private time of solitude and meditation.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the Dunston Retreat Center we make everything as easy as
            possible, providing meals, towels, bedding — everything you need.
            Just bring yourself.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm writing to tell you how much I enjoyed my retreat at Dunston. I
            came to your center haggard and worn out from a long illness and job
            difficulties. I left totally refreshed. I especially want to thank
            Father Thomas Holloway for his support.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've enthusiastically told all of my friends about the wonderful
            place you have. Some of us are hoping to organize a group retreat.
            Rest assured that you'll see me again. Going to Dunston will become
            a yearly event for me.
          </p>
