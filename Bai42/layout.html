      <h3>Run the Messier Marathon</h3>
      <p>
        <img id="logo" src="images/m20.jpg" alt="Article Logo" />
        It's time for the annual <b>Messier Marathon</b>. Instead of lacing up
        their Nikes, amateur astronomers will be hauling telescopes, star
        charts, and a hefty pot of coffee in an all-night vigil hunting the
        Messier objects.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Messier objects</b> are stellar objects, classified by astronomer
        <b>Charles Messier</b> in the 18th century, ranging from distant
        galaxies to star clusters to stellar nebula. March is the only month in
        the year in which all 110 Messier objects are in the sky. Unfortunately,
        if you want to see all of them, you have to start looking right after
        sunset and continue until just before sunrise — hence the term,
        "marathon."
      </p>

      <p>
        Ironically, Charles Messier wasn't all that interested in his objects.
        He made the list in order to <i>avoid</i> seeing them. Messier was more
        interested in discovering new comets and these beautiful stellar objects
        were often mistaken for comets before Messier made his list.
